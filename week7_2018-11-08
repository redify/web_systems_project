This week mostly focused on porting the work I had done on my personal server onto the weblab server.
I've also gone ahead an set up another mysql server on weblab an added a fake entry into it.

I modified the test php file I originally created to load the test entry from the DB and return it to the
html page.  This pull is triggered via clicking on the "test" button on the homepage.

All output is currenly piped into the console log.

The next steps are to add a php script that can take a HTTP put request to store temperature values that are read from
my temperature sensor.

This week has also had me purchase my second round of hardware for this temperature sensor.
My previous prototype worked for a short while, but I believe water caused corrosion and damaged the sensor.

I'll have to think of some way to keep the sensor safe from the elements without obstructing the sensors.

For next week:
- beautify the webcode
- add another php script on the weblab server to intercept http put request.
- rebuild the temperature sensor
- add python script to read from the sensor and send a http PUT request to the weblab server.
