So, I've run into some issues with the hardware.
last update, I believe I mentioned I purchased the sensor and its associated wires and attachments.
Well, I think I may have damaged the hardware (or there might be corrision on the chip, not sure yet).  I'm still investigating to see what happened, but I will likely need to buy another sensor.

This is the guide I used to solder the board together:

I do not have the hardware to test the circuits on, so I have resorted to purchasing another sensor unit.

In the mean time, I've focused my effors on setting of the apache web server and getting some code up here.
I have also initialized a MySQL database to store temperature, humidity, and pressure values.

The code I have pushed is more of a "this proves it works", rather than anything meaningful.
However, this is a good launching point to tie the PHP into the DB and start returning temperature values.
Even if I have issues witht he hardware for a little while, I can at least get the server working.
