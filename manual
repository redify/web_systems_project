Tools needed for temperature sensor:

Soldering Kit (solder, soldering iron, etc)
Raspberry Pi (Model 2 or later)
GPIO Header (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1992)
BME680 - Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Gas Sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660)
Copper wires

Directions:
First, some distribution of linux needs to be installed on the Raspberry PI.  I used Raspbian.
You then need to install a series of libraries in order to read IC2 data and the BME driver.
Required Libs:
Circuit Python (https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi)
Python3
CircuitPython BME Driver (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bme680-humidity-temperature-barometic-pressure-voc-gas/python-circuitpython)

Wiring instructions and test code are provided on that site as well.



Web and Server code and setup:

Tools:

Apache Server
MySQL
PHP
Javascript/HTML/CSS

The Apache server needs to be setup to use php.

The MySQL database needs to contain one table, called base_obs.
The table needs 4 columns, timestamp,temp,rh, and pressure.

Four Javascript libraries need to be included as well.
