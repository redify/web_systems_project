After a little tinkering, I am now able to remotely access my raspberry pi from outside my local network.

However, now that my Pi has been exposed, I need to think about some security precautions to prevent any bots from trying to
brute force my pi.  I choose an usually port for the forewarding, so it shouldn't be immediately obvious.

The next step is get work on the hardware and get stuff wired up.  I have made my choices on what I need. I'll be writing 
up about that shortly once I make an attempt at assembly.
