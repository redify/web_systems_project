So, I've run into some issues with the hardware.
last update, I believe I mentioned I purchased the sensor and its associated wires and attachments.
Well, I think I may have damaged the hardware (or there might be corrision on the chip, not sure yet).  I'm still investigating to see what happened, but I will likely need to buy another sensor.

It's not the end of the world.  Probably.

In the mean time, I've focused my effors on setting of the apache web server and getting some code up here.
I have also initialized a MySQL database to store temperature, humidity, and pressure values.

The code I have pushed is more of a "this proves it works", rather than anything meaningful.
However, this is a good launching point to tie the PHP into the DB and start returning temperature values.
Even if I have issues witht he hardware for a little while, I can at least get the server working.

In case you are curious, here is the link to my webserver at home
