*** CODE CHANGES ***
https://github.com/redify/web_systems_project/pull/5

WHAT I ACCOMPLISHED THIS WEEK:
I completely rewrote the frontend to finish off the web work.
This includes implementing all the css and javascript, and integrating the php returns into the website.

I used the following javascript libraries to complete my task:
jquery
jqueryui
moment.js
highstock/highcharts.

jqueryui was used for the tabs.
highstock and highcharts was used for the chart rendering.

The two data elements (the current temps on the left and the chart of the right) are automatically updated via ajax
on a timeout function.

I am using the two get php scripts I mentioend last week to pull the data.  Both php scripts return a json object, which can be
easily ingested into the javascript and used a js object.

For the css, I primarily positioned everything using flexbox.

DIFFICULTIES:
css and designing a website has always been a challenge for me.
The website went through multiple designs, and I struggled with the css to get it to do what I needed.
Flexbox is, by and far, the easiest method to position things on the webpage.  I still have to spend a considerable amount
of time looking documents up in order to get it to work, but its much simplier than just left shifting and width/height pixel shifting 
elements.
I brought in a few family members to look at and use the page to try and get a sense of what needed to change.
It's better than it was before, but it still needs work.
