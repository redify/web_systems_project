I've always had an interest in meteorology (in fact, I already have a bachelors degree in it!).
One thing that I have always wanted to do was monitor and record the weather conditions within and around my house.


My goal for this project is to create a small "weather station" for me to track and record 
weather conditions (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) within my house.
I will use a rasberry pie and wire some sensors to detect this data.

The data will be stored in a database (probably just on the pie).

The idea is that I will be able to remotely access current and past weather data from website
hosted either on my pie or the cs weblab servers.

I'll need to investigate cost efficient sensors (I'll probably have to sacrifice some accuracy to save money)
and manufactors that have good drivers and support.

I'll need to do a good chunk of research and practice with wiring and communicating with devices at a low level.
The hope is that the manufactorer that I purchase the sensor from will have documentation for drivers and wiring.

For now, I will only start with one indoor device.  Depending on how successful I am, I might look into adding additional indoor 
devices.
Adding an outdoor device will add alot of complexity and issues, so I'm doubtful that will happen.
