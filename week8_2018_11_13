*** CODE CHANGES FOR THE WEEK *** 
https://github.com/redify/web_systems_project/pull/3/files

Pretty productive week so far.

Last week I mentioned I was in the process of purchasing a new set of circuits to rebuild what I had originally.
I've finished up soldering and putting together a breadboard of the setup.

Link to the new sensor I got:

Wiring and setup guide:

Pictures of me building it:

I've included in the project a series of images I took while soldering and wiring the sensor.
This is technically my second prototype of the sensor.
I plan to solder it to a more permanent circuit board in the coming weeks.

I may also construct building a second sensor (for redundancy, as well as better coverage in my house).

The second major milestone I completed this week was settting up the drivers and script for the sensor.

I used circuitPython and manufactorer provided libraries to interface with the sensor.
I then built a simple python script called "pull_obs_data.py" that pulls the data from the 
sensor and sends it off in a http request to the cs.uml.edu servers.
This script is run automatically via crontab every 5 minutes.

The finally milestone for this week is finishing the server infrastructure for communication between my weather sensor
and the weblab servers.

A major hurtle I had to overcome was the communication between the weather sensor (which is off-campus and in my house) 
and the weblab servers (which require you to be on the schools network to connect with).
To get around this issue, I created a middleman php script thats only responsibility is to relay the messages it receives to the
weblab servers.

As I mentioned before, the python script send a http get request to the cs.uml.edu middleman php script.  The middleman script mirrors the
http request to the weblab server, which inserts those parameters into the database.

----------------

For next week, I will be building up the front end of the website to better visualize this data.
I may also spend time constructing a second prototype.
