So a few cool things have happened.

For one, I was able to get access to my raspberry pi.
After a little bruteforcing my passwords, I was able to get into the PI without having to flash it.

After, I worked on setting up port forwarding on my router and getting the PI to listen on the specific port I was forwarding.
It took my a few hours to figure out the issue I was having with my verizon router to port forward, but I figured
out the problem was a sshd_config issue on the PI (It was not listening on the new port I was forwarding).

I then setup my google domain (redweather.us) to resolve to the ip on my home router.
