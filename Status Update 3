So a few cool things have happened.

For one, I was able to get access to my raspberry pi.
After a little bruteforcing my passwords, I was able to get into the PI without having to flash it.

After, I worked on setting up port forwarding on my router and getting the PI to listen on the specific port I was forwarding.
It took my a few hours to figure out the issue I was having with my verizon router to port forward, but I figured
out the problem was a sshd_config issue on the PI (It was not listening on the new port I was forwarding).

I then setup my google domain (redweather.us) to resolve to the ip on my home router.

After a little tinkering, I am now able to remotely access my raspberry pi from outside my local network.

However, now that my Pi has been exposed, I need to think about some security precautions to prevent any bots from trying to
brute force my pi.  I choose an usually port for the forewarding, so it shouldn't be immediately obvious.

The next step is get work on the hardware and get stuff wired up.  I have made my choices on what I need. I'll be writing 
up about that shortly once I make an attempt at assembly.
