So, I've dug up my "old" rasberry pi (2, Model B) that I already had around the house.

I can't recall the login info, so I may need to wipe and reset whatever is on there.
Hopefully I backed up anything important.

I've been looking at a website that I have used in the past,
https://www.adafruit.com/

This is a great location to grab random bits of hardware for (primarily) ardinos and rasberry pi
Most of the stuff they have on there requires some leveling of wiring and low level work with the hardware.

I've come across a sensor that is cheap and does everything I was looking to do for a basic weather station.
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bme280-humidity-barometric-pressure-temperature-sensor-breakout/overview

They provide extensive documentation, drivers (based on python), and wiring instructions.
I think this is a great start.

I already have some spare wires, soldering tools, and a breakout board, so I can try experimenting with this soon.

The only worry I have is if it will be compatible with my Rasberry Pi 2.
