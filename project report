Meteorology has always been an interest/hobby of mine, and this project in particular was something I've always wanted to do.

In the past, I've always bought (rather expensive) devices that would monitor the temperature and conditions inside and outside of
my house.

However, I've always wanted to have more control over what I can do with that data collected.

The idea of the project is to setup a system in which I can monitor the weather conditions both inside and outside my house.
As a stretch goal, I wanted to be able to monitor the conditions outside as well.

The entire scope of this project was not reached.
The unit I produced is very much prototype.  Although it succeeds in at least monitoring conditions inside the house, 
it lacks protection from the elements, so it cannot survive outside the house.


Technical Overview:

This project has two main components: the sensor and the web server.

The sensor is a Paspberry PI connected to the BME 680 atmospheric sensor using the IC2 serial protocol for data communication
over the PI's GPIO bus.
The manufactorer provided python based libraries to communicate and decode the bits coming from the sensor of the IC2 port.

I wrote a small python script that pulls the temperature, relative humidity, and presssure from this sensor and, using a POST request,
sends this data to the cs.uml.edu webservers.   The script is triggered at a 5 minute interval using crontab.

This moves our discussion to the servers.

Since I am not able to connect to the directly to the weblab servers outside the school's network, I made a php script thats
sole purpose is to echo and POST request it gets to another PHP script on the weblab servers.  THe python script on the 
PI targets this "middleman" script on the cs.uml.edu servers.
This script then echos the POST to the weblab servers to another PHP script that takes this data and inserts it into a MySQL server.

The MySQL database has only one table, and this tables has four columns; temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and a datetime.

I have two other PHP scripts available available that act as the GET scripts to fetch data from the DB.
The first of these of scripts,
