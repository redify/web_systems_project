*** CODE CHANGES ***
<add link to pull request>

I primary expanded the fetch mechanics for this project this week.

I expanded the existing get current obs (getobsdata.php) script to return more data (rh, timestamp, pressure, temp),
as well as return the data as a json object.

I also added a new php script called range_get_obs_data.php.
This script is intended to return the historical recorded obs, currently for the past 24 hours.
The data is returned in an json object array.

Finally, I updated the javascript to call both php scripts on document load and run on a timeout function so
the php scripts are called and the values on the webpage are updated.

References I used to figure this out:

mysql and php...
https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_select.asp

Json object encode for php...
http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php

The reason I had the php return a json object was so that the javascript could easily translate it into a javascript object.

The next steps will be to update the javascript and add css to render the current obs and historical obs.

DIFFICULTIES:

I didn't really run into any issues.  Any difficulties I ran into were mostly
just figuring out via the guides I linked above.
