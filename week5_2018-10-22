Purchased most of the hardware I will need to at least get a prototype working.

Besides the fundumentals (soldering, solder, etc),
I purchased the BME280 I2C or SPI Temperature Humidity Pressure Sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652)
as my main sensor.

I also purchased (mostly on whim) and small LCD screen.  I'm not sure if I will actually use it, but I think it would be cool
to display this temp info visually without having to log into the machine or navigate to the website.

Some other things I purchased:
Breadboard for prototyping (plus breadboard wire bundles + Cobbler)
USB wifi dongle
Clear case for Raspberry Pi 2
"Perma" prototype breadboard hat for PI.  This is sorta cool.  I could, in theory, attach this to the PI and make a more complete
unit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2310).  I'm not sure if it will be big enough for both the screen and sensor.


Since I really want to start soldering, I've started working on the the sensor.  I've gone ahead and soldered the header strip to the BME 280.  I was able to practice a bit soldering before hand, so I think I avoided any cold joints.

We will see shortly if I messed anything up.

Wiring it should not be too hard. I can follow the instructions here.  This next part will not require any soldering, since I purchased
the breakout breadboard for that exact reason (for testing purposes)
